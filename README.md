## Available Scripts

The default location the Parser looks in for the roomPicks JSON is in Parser/data.
The default dir the Parser puts the processed JSON is App/public

Run npm i in App and Parser directories

The parsed json is requested from /public via an ajax call, so you will need to run the parser on the roomPicks JSON first. Then start the App.
